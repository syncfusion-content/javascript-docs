# Overview

The **Tab** control is an interface where list of items are expanded from a single item. Each **Tab** panel defines its header text or header template, as well as a content template. **Tab** items are dynamically added and removed. **Tabs** can be loaded with AJAX content that is useful for building dashboards where space is limited.

**Key Features**

* **Collapsible header:** All headers are collapsible.
* **AJAX load:** Load AJAX content in the Tab content panel.
* **Close button:** Provides a close button for each Tab item.
* **Custom event for expanding header:** Activate a Tab item on a single click, or bind custom events such as mouse over or mouse up to activate a Tab.
* **Header orientation:** Change the header position to the top or bottom of the control.
* **Persist:** Save the current model value to browser cookies to maintain the state.
* **Height style:** Adjust the content panel height.
* **RTL:** Tab headers and content can display right-to-left languages.****
* **Add Tab dynamically:** New Tab items can be added and removed at run time.
* **Theme:** Essential JavaScript controls feature 12 built-in themes, six flat themes and six with gradient effects, and also support custom skin options to set user-defined themes.
