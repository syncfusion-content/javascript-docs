### Angular Binding

**Angular binding** is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It allows you to use **HTML** as your template language and extend **HTML's** syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly.

In order to achieve angular binding, refer the following script files.

* angular.min.js

* ej.widget.angular.min.js
