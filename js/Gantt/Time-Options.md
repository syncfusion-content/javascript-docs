# Time Options

The start date and end date in datasource defines the starting point and ending point of a task in the project. It can be of two data types.

* Date 
* Datetime

The datetime data type for start date and end date defines the exact starting point and ending point of a task along with time details of a day. There are two types of time scales available based on working hours,

* `TimeScale8Hours`  for 8 hour working scale.
* `TimeScale24Hours` for 24 hour working scale.

Use the [`workingTimeScale`](/api/js/ejgantt#members:workingtimescale) property for setting different time scales of working hours in Gantt, refer the following code example to define working hours for your project.

{% highlight javascript %}

    $("#GanttContainer").ejGantt({
        //...
        workingTimeScale: ej.Gantt.workingTimeScale.TimeScale24Hours,
    });

{% endhighlight %}

Use the following code example for including time options in start date and end date of a task.

{% highlight javascript %}

        varÂ taskDetails = [{
            taskID: 1,
            taskName: "Planning",
