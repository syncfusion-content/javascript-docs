# Data Exploration

## Filtering

### Filtering by Member

After clicking Split button of a dimension, Member Editor Dialog opens through which members are filtered by checking and unchecking the check boxes corresponding to the members.  On clicking the OK button, based on the selected members in the Member Editor Dialog, OLAP Report gets updated and refreshes the PivotGrid and OlapChart controls.  The Cancel button is used for canceling the selection.

The above filter illustrates that the members France and Germany, along with New South Wales and Queensland are filtered from the Grid and Chart controls.

### Filtering by Value

The Filtering tab in the Sorting and Filtering dialog box of OlapClient provides the options to specify custom filters on the multidimensional data. It enables the user to filter the rows and columns of the selected Measure.

* **Column Filter** - Filters the column in which all of the row items fails to satisfy the filter condition.
* **Row Filter** - Filters the row in which all of the column items fails to satisfy the filter condition.

Sorting and Filtering dialog box for rows and columns are opened by clicking the corresponding icon in the toolbar.

## Grouping

The data can be grouped when more than one dimension element is added to Categorical or Series in Axis Element Builder.  Based on the order of addition, data is grouped and the report is updated. In the following example, the **Date** dimension values get grouped, with respect to **Customer** dimension values.  Likewise multiple dimension members can be grouped by dragging the elements from Cube Dimension Browsers to Axis Element Builder.
