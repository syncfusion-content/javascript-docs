# Overview

The pivot tree map control allows you to visualize the OLAP data in the form of nested nodes in hierarchical order with the ability to drill up and down.

## Key features

* **Data source** - Binds the pivot tree map control with the Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) and XML/A data sources.
* **Drill support** - Enables you to navigate through the inner levels of a hierarchy elements.
* **Color mapping** - Allows you to differentiate leaf nodes using various color codes based on their value or members.
* **Legend** - Differentiates the color code based on the value range (from minimum to maximum).
