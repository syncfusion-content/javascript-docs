# How To

## Update the modified data from tree to database

TreeView allow you to get the updated tree data after performing such operation like node editing, drag and drop, add and remove node. Using [getTreeData](https://help.syncfusion.com/api/js/ejtreeview#methods:gettreedata) method you can get the updated tree data. 

Refer the sample from the link [Updated tree data](http://jsplayground.syncfusion.com/3f1qqqm1#) to know how to get updated data from TreeView.

You can also get the updated data source for remote data binding after performing the operation like editing, selecting/unselecting, expanding/collapsing, checking/unchecking and removing node. You cannot get the updated data source when you perform operation like drag and drop, adding node for remote data binding.

The updated data source also contains custom attributes ("ContactTitle", "OrderID", "EmployeeID", "Freight") if you return these from server.

Refer the sample from the [link](http://jsplayground.syncfusion.com/Sync_aeirbejs) to know more about how to get updated data with custom attributes from TreeView for remote data binding.
