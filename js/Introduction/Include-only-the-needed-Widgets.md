# Include only the needed Widgets

The users with **Essential Studio Enterprise license** or **Essential Studio for JavaScript license** can make use of the **Custom Script Generator** (CSG) tool to create a single file that packs together only the required scripts and css files together. Referring only the required scripts and stylesheets in your application instead of the default **ej.web.all.js** (which combines the scripts of all the widgets) file, will enhance the performance of the applicationâ€™s loading time. This utility can be used to generate both the minified and non-minified version of the scripts and CSS files.

## Getting Started with Custom Script Generator

Log into the online CSG [link](http://csg.syncfusion.com/) with your **DirectTrac** credentials. The Custom Script Generator Utility options within the **Desktop** tab will be displayed as shown below,

Select the required version from the **Version** list and also select the output file type either to be generated as a **minified** or **non-minified** version. Now, click on the Generate button and provide a name to the file to be generated as shown below,
{% include image.html url="/js/Introduction/Include-only-the-needed-Widgets_images/Include-only-the-needed-Widgets_img2.png" %}

Once the Generate button is clicked, the combining process of selected scripts is executed and this will take several minutes. When the process is done, the **Download** button will become available through which you can download the requested files combined and make use of it in your application as per your needs.
