# Adding Calculation Support

**ej.calculate.min.js** contains the **CalcEngine** class to add the calculation support to your application. You can add the calculation support to any data (like grid). **CalcEngine** enables you to easily add formula parsing calculation support to arbitrary business objects and you can also add calculation support to any data class by having the **GetValueRowCol** and **SetValueRowCol** methods in the application.

Refer to **Getting Started** section to know more about adding **CalcEngine** in data class.
