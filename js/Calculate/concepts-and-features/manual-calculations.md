# Manual Calculations

**Manual calculation** requires you to explicitly request **ej.calculate.js** to compute the value and return it. You can achieve this by invoking methods in the **CalcEngine** class. **parseAndCompute** method accepts a formula string, parses it, and returns the computed value of the parsed formula. You can also directly invoke computation methods for any of the library functions of **ej.calculate** through the **CalcEngine** class.
