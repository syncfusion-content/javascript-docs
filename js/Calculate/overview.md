# Overview

**Essential Calculate for JavaScript** is an UI independent **JavaScript** engine that enables you to add formula calculation support to web application. The range of calculations include simple algebraic expressions such as (1.2^3-1)/8, to formulas using intrinsic functions like 4 * sqrt(exp(8.4)), to formulas relying on variables that are defined through controls on  application page such as cos(A1 * pi()/180), to spreadsheet-like formulas such as Sum(A2:B14). **Essential Calculate** allows you to parse and compute these expressions. This function library is easily extendable. The data used in the calculations can be from any source, ranging from fixed values to values that are entered through the controls to data tables and Excel spreadsheets.

**Key Features**
