# Supported Algebra

The explicit look of a valid formula in **ej.calculate.js** can vary depending upon the context of the formula. For example, when you use a formula in **CalcEngine** based on an Excel spreadsheet, then a formula such as = A1 + A3 is valid since **CalcEngine** recognizes the **A1** and **A3** as valid cell references.
