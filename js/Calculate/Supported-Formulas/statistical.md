* If Tails is any value other than 1 or 2, TDIST returns the #NUM! error value.



* If x < 0, then TDIST returns the #NUM! error value.



* If Tails = 1, TDIST is calculated as TDIST = P( X>x ), where X is a random variable that follows the t-distribution. If Tails = 2, TDIST is calculated as TDIST = P(&#124;X&#124; > x) = P(X > x or X < -x).



* Since x < 0 is not allowed, to use TDIST when x < 0, note that TDIST(-x,df,1) = 1 â€“ TDIST(x,df,1) = P(X >-x) and TDIST(-x,df,2) = TDIST(x,df,2) = P(&#124;X&#124; > x).



## T.INV



The `T.INV` returns the left-tailed inverse of the Student's t-distribution.



**Syntax:**



_T.INV(probability,deg_freedom)_



**where:**



* Probability is the probability associated with the Student's t-distribution.



* Deg_freedom is the number of degrees of freedom with which to characterize the distribution.



**Remarks:**



* If either argument is non-numeric, T.INV returns the `#VALUE!` error value.



* If probability <= 0 or if probability >1, T.INV returns the #NUM! error value.



* If deg_freedom is not an integer, it is truncated.



* If deg_freedom < 1, T.INV returns the #NUM! error value.



## TRIMMEAN



Returns the mean of the interior of a data set. `TRIMMEAN` calculates the mean taken by excluding a percentage of data points from the top and bottom tails of a data set.



**Syntax:**



_TRIMMEAN(array, percent)_



**where:**



* array is the array or range of values to trim and average.



* percent is the fractional number of data points to exclude from the calculation. For example, if percent = 0.2, 4 points are trimmed from a data set of 20 points (20 x 0.2): 2 from the top and 2 from the bottom of the set.



**Remarks:**



* Percent must be >= 0 and <= 1.



* TRIMMEAN rounds off the number of excluded data points down to the nearest multiple of 2. If percent = 0.1, 10 percent of 30 data points equals 3 points. For symmetry, TRIMMEAN excludes a single value from the top and bottom of the data set.



## VAR.P



Calculates variance based on the entire population (ignores logical values and text in the population).



**Syntax:**



_VAR.P(number1,[number2],...)_



**where:**



* Number1 is the first number argument corresponding to a population.



* Number2, ... is Optional. Number arguments 2 to 254 corresponding to a population.



**Remarks:**



* VAR.P assumes that its arguments are the entire population. If your data represents a sample of the population, then compute the variance by using VAR.S.



* Arguments can either be numbers or names, arrays, or references that contain numbers.



* Logical values, and text representations of numbers that you type directly into the list of arguments are counted.



* If an argument is an array or reference, only numbers in that array or reference are counted. Empty cells, logical values, text, or error values in the array or reference are ignored.



* Arguments that are error values or text that cannot be translated into numbers cause errors.



* If you want to include logical values and text representations of numbers in a reference as part of the calculation, use the VARPA function.



## VARPA



Calculates variance based on the entire population. In addition to numbers and text, logical values such as True and False are also included in the calculation.



**Syntax:**



_VARPA(value1, value2, ...)_



**where:**



* value1, value2, ... are arguments corresponding to a population.



**Remarks:**



* VARPA assumes that its arguments are the entire population. If your data represents a sample of the population, you must compute the variance using VARA.



* Arguments that contain True evaluate as 1; arguments that contain text or False evaluate as 0 (zero). If the calculation does not include text or logical values, use the VARP worksheet function instead.



## VARA



The `VarA` function returns the variance of a population based on a sample of numbers, text, and logical values (ie: TRUE or FALSE).



**Syntax:**



_VARA( value1, value2, ... value_n )_



**where:**



* value1, value2, ... value_n are the sample values. They can be numbers, text, and logical values. Values that are TRUE are evaluated as 1. Values that are FALSE or text values are evaluated as 0. 30 values can be entered.



## WEIBULL.DIST



The `Weibull.Dist` function returns the Weibull Distribution.



**Syntax:**



_WEIBULL.DIST(x,alpha,beta,cumulative)_



**where:**



* x is the value that evaluates the function.



* alpha is a parameter of the distribution.



* beta is a parameter of the distribution.



* cumulative determines the form of the function.



**Remarks:**



* `#NUM!` occurs when x is lesser than zero and when alpha or beta is equal to or lesser than zero.



* `#VALUE!` occurs when beta is non-numeric.



## ZTEST



`ZTest` function returns the one-tailed probability value of a z-test.



**Syntax:**



_ZTEST(a1,T_value,sigma)_ 



**where:**



* array is an array or range of data.



* T_value is the value to test..



* sigma  is the population (known) standard deviation.
