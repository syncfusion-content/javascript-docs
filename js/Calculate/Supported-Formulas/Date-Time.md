# Date & Time 

## DATE



The `Date` function returns the sequential serial number that represents a particular date.



**Syntax:**



_DATE(year, month, day)_



**where:**



* year can be one to four digits. Year is interpreted based on 1900.



* When a year is between 0 (zero) and 1899 (inclusive), the value is added to 1900 to calculate the year. For example, Date (102, 11, 12) returns as November 12, 2002 (1900+102).



* When a year is between 1900 and 9999 (inclusive), the value is used as it is, for example, Date(2002,11,12) returns as November 12, 2002.



* month is a number representing the month of the year.



* day is a number representing the day of the month.



**Remarks:**



* Dates are stored as sequential serial numbers so that they can be used in calculations. By default, January 1, 1900 is serial number 1 and November 12, 2002 is serial number 37572 because it is 37572 days after January 1, 1900.



## DATEValue



The `DateValue` function returns the serial number of the date represented by the date_text.



**Syntax:**



_DATEVALUE(date_text)_



**where:**



* date_text is the text that represents a date as a formatted string. For example, 11/12/2002 or 12-Nov-2002 are text strings within quotation marks that represent dates. When the year portion of the date_text is omitted, DateValue uses the current year from your computer's built-in clock. The time information in the date_text is ignored.



**Remarks:**



* Dates are stored as sequential serial numbers so that they can be used in calculations. By default, January 1, 1900 is serial number 1, and November 12, 2002 is serial number 37572 because it is 37572 days after January 1, 1900.



* Most functions automatically convert date values to serial numbers.



## DAY



The `Day` function returns the day of a date represented by a serial number. The `Day` is given as an integer ranging from 1 to 31.



**Syntax:**



_DAY(serial_number)_



**where:**



* serial_number is the date of the day you are trying to find. Dates should be entered by using the `Date` function or as results of other formulas or functions. For example, use Date(2002,4,23) for the 23rd day of April, 2002.



## DAYS360



The `Days360` function returns the number of days between two dates based on a 360-day year (twelve 30-day months) that is used in some accounting calculations.



**Syntax:**



_DAYS360(start_date, end_date, method)_



**where:**



* start_date and end_date are the two dates between which you want to know the number of days. When start_date occurs after end_date, `Days360` returns a negative number. Dates should be entered by using the **Date** function or as results of other formulas or functions.



* method is a logical value that specifies whether to use the U.S. or European method in the calculation. When method is:



* False or omitted-The calculation uses the U.S. (NASD) method. When the starting date is the 31st of a month, it becomes equal to the 30th of the same month. When the ending date is the 31st of a month and the starting date is earlier than the 30th of a month, the ending date becomes equal to the 1st of the next month, otherwise the ending date becomes equal to the 30th of the same month.



* True-The calculation uses the European method. Starting dates and ending dates that occur on the 31st of a month become equal to the 30th of the same month.



## DAYS



The `Days` function retrieves the number of days between two dates.



**Syntax:**



_DAYS(endDate, startDate)_



**where:**



* endDate and startDate are the two dates between which you want to know the number of days.



## EDATE



The `EDate` function returns a date that is a specified number of months before or after a supplied start date. 



**Syntax:**



_EDATE( startDate, Months )_ 



**where:**



* startDate is the initial date from where to count the number of months. 



* Months is the number of months to add to (or subtract from) the startDate.



**Remarks:**



* `#VALUE!` occurs when the supplied startDate is not a valid date.



* `#VALUE!` occurs when the supplied Months argument is non-numeric.



## EOMONTH



The `EOMONTH` function returns the last day of the month that is a specified number of months before or after an initially supplied start date.  



**Syntax:**



_EOMONTH(startDate, Months)_ 



**where:**



* startDate is the initial date.



* Months is the number of months to add to (or subtract from) the startDate before returning the last day of the resulting month. 



**Remarks:**



* `#VALUE!` occurs when any of the supplied argument is not a numeric value. 



* `#NUM!` occurs when the supplied startDate is not a valid date.



* `#NUM!` occurs when the supplied startDate plus the value of the months argument is not a valid date.



## HOUR



The `Hour` function returns the hour of a time value. The hour is given as an integer, ranging from 0 (12:00 A.M.) to 23 (11:00 P.M.).



**Syntax:**



_HOUR(serial_number)_



**where:**



* serial_number is the time that contains the hour you want to find. Times may be entered as text strings within quotation marks for example, "6:00 PM", as decimal numbers for example, 0.75, that represents 6:00 PM, or as results of other formulas or functions for example, TimeValue"6:00 PM".



## ISOWEEKNUM



For a given date, the `ISOWeekNum` function returns the ISO week number of that year.



**Syntax:**



_ISOWEEKNUM( DateTime)_ 



**where:**



* DateTime is used for date and time calculation.



**Remarks:**



* `#NUM!` occurs when the date argument is not a valid number.



* `#VALUE!` occurs when the date argument is not a valid date type.



## MINUTE



The `Minute` function returns the minutes of a time value. The `Minute` is given as an integer ranging from 0 to 59.



**Syntax:**



_MINUTE(serial_number)_



**where:**



* serial_number is the time that contains the minute you want to find. Times may be entered as text strings within quotation marks (for example, "6:00 PM"), as decimal numbers (for example, 0.75, that represents 6:00 PM), or as results of other formulas or functions (for example, TIMEVALUE ("6:00 PM")). 



**Remarks:**



* Time values are a portion of a date value represented by a decimal number (for example, 12:00 PM is represented as 0.5).



## MONTH



The `Month` function returns the month of a date represented by a serial number. The `Month` is given as an integer ranging from 1 (January) to 12 (December).



**Syntax:**



_MONTH(serial_number)_



**where:**



* serial_number is the date of the month you are trying to find. Dates should be entered by using the `Date` function or as results of other formulas or functions. For example, use Date(2002,11,12) for the 12th day of November, 2002.



**Remarks:**



* Dates are stored as sequential serial numbers so that they can be used in calculations. By default, January 1, 1900 is serial number 1 and January 1, 2008 is serial number 39448 because it is 39,448 days after January 1, 1900.



## NETWORKDAYS



The `Networkdays` function is used to calculate the number of whole work days between two given dates. This includes all weekdays from Monday to Friday, but excludes a supplied list of holidays.



**Syntax:**



_NETWORKDAYS( start_date, end_date, [holidays] )_



**where:**



* start_date: The start of the period to find the working days



* end_date: The end of the period to find the working days.

**Notes:**


â€¢ If any argument is not a valid date, NETWORKDAYS returns the `#VALUE!` error value.

`Networkdays.intl` calculates the number of whole work days between two supplied dates.



**Syntax:**



_NETWORKDAYS.INTL(startDate, endDate)_ 



**where:**



* startDate is the start of the period where days are counted.



* endDate is the end of the period where days are counted.



**Remarks:**



* `#VALUE!` occurs when the supplied startDate and endDate are not valid dates. 



## NOW

**Syntax:**



_SECOND(serial_number)_



**where:**



* serial_number is the time that contains the seconds you want to find.
