<div id="scrollcontent" style="width:900px;">
<p>Model view controller (MVC) is a software architecture pattern which separates the
representation of information from the user's interaction with it.
The model consists of application data, business rules, logic, and functions. A view can be any
output representation of data, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views of the same data 
are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants. 
The controller mediates input, converting it to commands for the model or view.The central 
ideas behind MVC are code reusability and n addition to dividing the application into three 
kinds of components, the MVC design defines the interactions between them.

<p>Model view controller (MVC) is a software architecture pattern which separates the
representation of information from the user's interaction with it.
The model consists of application data, business rules, logic, and functions. A view can be any
output representation of data, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views of the same data 
are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants. 
The controller mediates input, converting it to commands for the model or view.The central
