# Drag And Drop

 ejDraggable and ejDroppable widgets can be combined together to perform drag and drop functions in required scenarios. ejDraggable allows a DOM element to be moved using mouse whereas ejDroppable makes a DOM element Droppable

## Key Features

* **Drag and Drop** - Allows drag and drop of DOM elements.
* **Drag Area** - The drag area is used to restrict the dragging element bounds.Â 
* **Scope** - Used to group sets of draggable and droppable items. A draggable with the same scope value will be accepted by the droppable.
* **Cursor At** - Sets the offset of the dragging helper relative to the mouse cursor.
