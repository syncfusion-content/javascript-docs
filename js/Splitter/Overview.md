# Overview

**The Essential JavaScript Splitter** is a layout control that enables you to divide a Web page into distinct areas by inserting resizable panes. You can create any number of **Splitter** panes and place them inside the **Splitter** control. The split bars are inserted automatically in between the adjacent panes. 

**Key Features**

* **Expand or Collapse Panes** : Support for expanding or collapsing panes by using the Expand or Collapse arrows.

* **Animation** : Supports for animating panes while expanding or collapsing the panes, and also setting the animation speed.

* **Window Resizing** : Supports for resizing the Splitter while resizing the window.

* **RTL** : Supports for right to left alignment of Splitter panes.

* **Themes** : Essential JavaScript controls consist of 12 built-in themes (6 – flat and 6 – gradient effects), and also support custom skins that enable to set user-defined themes.
