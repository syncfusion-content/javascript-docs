# License Key Registration

You must have an active Syncfusion Essential JS license to use Syncfusion Essential JS2 or Essential JS1 (.js files). However, if you only use the Syncfusion Essential JavaScript product, you do not need to register the Syncfusion License keys in your scripts (.js files).

For the following platforms, you can use the script files without registering the license keys.

### **JavaScript (Essential JS 1)**

* AngularJS

* Angular

* Aurelia

* ReactJS
