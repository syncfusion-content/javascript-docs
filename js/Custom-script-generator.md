# Include only the needed widgets

The users with Essential Studio Enterprise license or Essential Studio for JavaScript license can make use of the Custom Script Generator (CSG) tool to create a single file that packs together only the required scripts and CSS files together. This utility can generate both the minified and uncompressed version of the scripts and CSS files.

## Getting started with Custom Script Generator

Log into the [portal](http://csg.syncfusion.com/) with your DirectTrac credentials. The Custom Script Generator Utility options within the **Desktop** tab will be displayed as shown below,

Once the Generate button is clicked, the combining process of selected scripts is executed and this will take several minutes. When the process is done, the **Download** button will become available through which you can download the requested files combined and make use of it in your application as per your needs.

Select the required list of controls, version, output file-type (either minified or non-minified versions) and then click on the **Save Settings** button. Provide a meaningful name to the file and click on the **Save** button.
