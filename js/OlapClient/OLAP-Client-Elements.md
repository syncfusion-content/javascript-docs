# OlapClient: Elements

## Cube Selector
Cube Selector allows to select any one of the cube from the cubes available in connected database.  This can be achieved with a dropdown list displaying the list of names of cubes. On selecting a cube from the dropdown list the corresponding cube elements get loaded.

## Cube Dimension Browser
Cube Dimension Browser is a treeview like structure that organizes the cube elements such as dimensions, hierarchies, measures, etc., from the selected cube into independent, logical groups.

### Types of Node in Cube Dimension Browser

* **Display Folder** - Folder that contains a set of similar elements.
* **Measure** - Quantity available for analysis.
* **Dimension** - A name given to the parts of the cube that categorize the data.
* **Attribute Hierarchy** - Level of attributes down the hierarchy.
* **User-defined Hierarchy** - Members of a dimension in a hierarchical structure.
* **Level** - Denotes a specific level in the category.
* **Named Set** - A collection of tuples and members, which can be defined and saved as a part of the cube definition.

### Attribute Hierarchy
Attribute hierarchy contains the following levels:

* A leaf level contains each distinct attribute member called leaf member with each member of the leaf level.
* Intermediate levels if the attribute hierarchy is a parent-child hierarchy.
* An optional (All) level (IsAggregatable=True) containing the aggregated value of the attribute hierarchy’s leaf members, with the member of the (All) level also known as the (All) member.

### User-Defined Hierarchy
User-defined hierarchy organizes the members of a dimension into hierarchical structure and provides navigation paths in a cube. For example, take a dimension table that supports three attributes such as Year, Quarter and Month. The Year, Quarter and Month attributes are used to construct a user-defined hierarchy, named Calendar, in the time dimension which relates all the levels.

### Differentiating User-defined hierarchy and Attribute hierarchy

* User-defined hierarchy may contain more than one level whereas attribute hierarchy contains only one level.
* User-defined hierarchy provides the navigation path between the levels taken from attribute hierarchies of the same dimension.
* In our component, visually these two types are differed by the folder icons mentioned in the immediate topic.

##Axis Element Builder
Axis Element Builder allows you to build the elements in the axes of OlapClient.  It supports three axes namely Categorical, Series and Slicer. Based on the construction of axes, PivotGrid and OlapChart will display the resultant data.

### Categorical (Column)
The categorical axis defines one or more elements that are displayed along the Chart’s y-axis as labels and in the columns of the Grid. If more than one dimension is on the categorical axis, the Chart/Grid will stack each dimension. The order in which the dimensions are stacked is based on the order that they appear on the categorical axis.

### Series (Row)
The series axis defines one or more dimensions that are displayed along the Chart’s x-axis as labels and in the rows of the Grid. If more than one dimension is on the series axis, the Chart/Grid will stack each dimension. The order in which the dimensions are stacked is based on the order that they appear on the series axis.

### Slicer
The slicer axis is used as a filter to narrow the focus of the multidimensional data displayed in the Chart/Grid. The slicer axis lets you analyze any member of a dimension, in-depth. For the slicer to display the member’s data, that member must not be present on both categorical axis and series axis.

### Split Button
Split Button highlights the elements in the Axis Element Builder. It holds measures, dimensions, named set. When a dimension/hierarchy/level/named set node is dragged and dropped from Cube Dimensional Browser into Axis Element Builder, a Split Button is created displaying the corresponding dimension/named set caption. 

When a measure node is dragged and dropped, the Axis Element Builder will create a Split Button for holding the Measures. The next time a measure is added, it maintains the same single Split Button to hold the entire measure collection.
 
Split Buttons can be removed with the help of delete icon available in it.

### Addition Elements to an Axis
The measure, dimension, hierarchy, level and named set elements can be dragged from the Cube Dimension Browser and dropped into the Axis Element Builder at desired position using the drag-and-drop operation.  Also the measure, dimension, hierarchy, level and named set elements can be moved from one axis to another by dragging an appropriate Split Button and dropping them at desired position.

### Remove Elements from an Axis
In order to remove measures, dimension, hierarchy, level and named set element from the Axis Element Builder, click the remove symbol available next to the Split Button.

![](OLAP-Client-Elements_images/Removing elements from AEB.png)

### Rearrange Elements in an Axis
Rearranging can be done by dragging an element and dropping at desired position.
