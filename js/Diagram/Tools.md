# Tools

## Drawing Tools

Drawing tool allows you to draw any kind of node/connector during runtime by clicking and dragging on diagram page. 

### Shapes

To draw a shape, you need to set the JSON of that shape to the `drawType` property of diagram model and you have to activate the drawing tool using the `tool` property. The following code example illustrates how to draw a rectangle at run time. 

{% highlight js %}

var diagram = $("#diagram").ejDiagram("instance");

//JSON to create a rectangle
diagram.model.drawType = {
    type: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.Shapes.Basic,
    shape: "rectangle",
    //customize the appearance of the shape
    fillColor: "#fcbc7c",
    borderColor: "#f89b4c",
    labels: [{
        "text": "Rectangle"
    }]
};

//To draw an object once, activate draw once
diagram.update({
    tool: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.Tool.DrawOnce,
});

//To draw an object multiple times, activate continuous draw tool
diagram.update({
    tool: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.Tool.ContinousDraw,
});

{% endhighlight %}

Following code snippet illustrates how to draw a path.

{% highlight js %}

     var diagram = $("#diagram").ejDiagram("instance");
     diagram.model.drawType = {
         name: "Path",
         fillColor: "#fbe172",
         labels: [{
             text: "Path"
         }],
         shape: "path",
         pathData: "M13.560 67.524 L 21.941 41.731 L 0.000 25.790 L 27.120 25.790 L 35.501 0.000 L 43.882 25.790 L 71.000 25.790 L 49.061 41.731 L 57.441 67.524 L 35.501 51.583 z "
     };
     
     //To draw an object once, activate draw once
    diagram.update({
        tool: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.Tool.DrawOnce,
    });

 {% endhighlight %}

{% include image.html url="/js/Diagram/Tools_images/Tools_img3.png" %}    

### Connectors

To draw connectors, you have to set the JSON of the connector to `drawType` property. The drawing tool can be activated using the `tool` property as shown below. The following code example illustrates how to draw a straight line connector. 

{% highlight js %}

var diagram = $("#diagram").ejDiagram("instance");
//JSON to create a straight line connector
diagram.model.drawType = {
    type: "connector",
    segments: [{
        type: "straight"
    }]
};
//To draw an object once, activate draw once
diagram.update({
    tool: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.Tool.DrawOnce
});

{% endhighlight %}

{% include image.html url="/js/Diagram/Tools_images/Tools_img2.png" %}

### Text 

DiagramÂ allows you to create a textNode as soon as you click on diagram page. The following code illustrates how to draw a text.

{% highlight js %}

var diagram = $("#diagram").ejDiagram("instance");

//JSON to draw a text 
diagram.model.drawType = { type: "text" };

diagram.update({
    tool: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.Tool.DrawOnce
});

{% endhighlight %}

Once you activated the texttool, you can also able to perform label editing of a node/connector.

## Tool Selection

There are some functionalities that can be achieved by clicking and dragging on the diagram surface. They are as follows.

* Draw selection rectangle - MultipleSelect tool
* Pan the diagram - Zoom pan
* Draw nodes/connectors - ContinuousDraw / DrawOnce

As all three behaviors are completely different, You can achieve only one behavior at a time based on the tool that you choose.
If more than one of those tools are applied, a tool will be activated based on the precedence given in the following table. 

<table>
<tr>
<th>
Precedence</th><th>
Tools</th><th>
Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
1st </td><td>
ContinuesDraw</td><td>
Allows you to draw the nodes or connectors continuously. Once it is activated we could not perform any other interaction in the diagram. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
2nd </td><td>
DrawOnce</td><td>
Allows you to draw single node or connector. Once you completed the drawOnce action, SingleSelect and MultipleSelect tools will be automatically enabled. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
3rd </td><td>
ZoomPan</td><td>
Allows you to pan the diagram. If you enabled both SingleSelect and ZoomPan tools, you can able to perform the basic interaction when cursors hovers node/connector and panning will be enabled when cursor hovers diagram.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
4th </td><td>
MultipleSelect</td><td>
Allows you to select multiple nodes and connectors. If you enabled both MultipleSelect and ZoomPan tools, when cursor hovers the diagram, panning will be enabled and you cannot to select multiple nodes. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
5th </td><td>
SingleSelect</td><td>
Allows you to select individual nodes or connectors.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
6th </td><td>
None</td><td>
Disables all tools</td></tr>
</table>

You can set the desired tool to the `tool` property of diagram model. The following code illustrates how to enable single/multiple tools.

{% highlight js %}

// To Enable Single Tool 
$("#diagram").ejDiagram({
    // To Enable a Single Selection
    tool: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.Tool.SingleSelect
});

// Enable multiple tools
$("#diagram").ejDiagram({
    // Select when you click on a node and pan when you click on diagram surface
    tool: ej.datavisualization.Diagram.Tool.SingleSelect | ej.datavisualization.Diagram.Tool.ZoomPan
});
