# Sorting

Sorting controls the order in which the data appears in a data region. Sort data in a dataset query, or define a sort expression for a data region or group.

1. For each sort expression, follow these steps:

   * Click **Add**.

   * Type or select an expression by which the data will be sorted.

   * From the drop-down list, choose the sort direction for each expression. 
   
        **Ascending** sorts an expression in A-Z order. 

        **Descending** sorts an expression in Z-A order.

2. Click OK.

> Note: For effective sorting experience, apply sorting to the column with string data.
