# Insert Image

You can insert all types of images from a defined path** **in **RichTextEditor** control. You can even insert your companyâ€™s logo in the page. When you explain about your product, insert images related to the product, for more interaction with viewers. And it also provides some additional features such as border support, navigation link support and custom styles for images.
