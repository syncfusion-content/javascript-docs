# Insert Table

If you need to present information in rows and columns, then a table is the obvious choice. While tables are great to display content in your documents, you can also use them for quick and easy forms or to create complex page layouts in a snap. Even if it is only a few rows or columns, tables are easier to use than tabs and less likely to go wrong. 

### Steps to insert a table

#### Method 1

Click the table tool item to display a grid of squares. Hover on the grid to select the number of **columns** and **rows** in the table. 

#### Method 2

You can also use the “**Create custom table**” link below the grid. This link opens the “**Create custom table**” popup window. In this popup window, specify the number of rows and columns that need to be created. 

This popup window contains options to change the width and height of cells, cells spacing, cells padding, and many more.
