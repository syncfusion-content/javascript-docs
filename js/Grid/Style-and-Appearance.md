# Style and Appearance

Style and appearance of **Grid** are based on CSS class. You need two style sheets to apply styles to **Grid** control; one **ej.widgets.core.min.css** and one **ej.theme.min.css**. If you use **ej.widgets.all.min.css** then you don’t need to use **ej.widgets.core.min.css** and **ej.theme.min.css** because **ej.widgets.all.min.css** is a combination of these two.
