# Web accessibility

Web accessibility is an easy way to create a website or application by world wide users, including disabled users. You can develop sites with the help of assistive technologies. **Essential JavaScript** supports the **Web UI** accessibility resources. They are:

**WAI – ARIA supports in Essential JavaScript Grid**

This helps enable better user interaction in **Grid** control and this uses the W3C’s Widget Design Patterns in the WAI specification and added customize attributes.

**Full Keyboard control supports in Essential JavaScript Grid**

This helps to support **Grid** control with keyboard interaction. The key descriptions are:

{% highlight js %}

Alt + j				= focus
Ctrl + Home			= first row in Grid
Ctrl + End			= last row in Grid
PgDn				= next page to Grid
PgUp				= previous page to Grid
Home				= first cell in grid
End			= last cell in grid
F2			= Edit            //to enable editing [edit:{allowEditing:true}]
Enter				= Save request
Esc			= Cancel request
Tab			= Move Cell right
Shift					= Move Cell left
Ctrl + PgDn				= Last page in grid
Ctrl + Alt + PgUp		= First page in grid
Alt + Down Arrow		= Expand selected group //to enable [grouping{allowGrouping:true}]
Alt + Up Arrow			= Collapse selected group //to enable [grouping{allowGrouping:true}]
Ctrl + Down Arrow		= Expand All //to enable [grouping{allowGrouping:true}]
Ctrl + UP Arrow			= Collapse All //to enable [grouping{allowGrouping:true}]
