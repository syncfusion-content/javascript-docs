### Initialize ejGrid

In this section, you can learn about **Gridâ€™s** mandatory property to render a simple **Grid**. To initialize **Grid**, it needs two important properties. They are columns and its inner property field. [`columns`](/js/api/ejgrid#members:columns "columns") are used to define schema of **Grid** and [`field`](/js/api/ejgrid#members:columns-field "field") is mapping a name to the data source.

{% highlight js %}

$("#Grid").ejGrid({
     columns: [
        { field: "OrderID" },
        { field: "CustomerID" },
        { field: "EmployeeID" }
     ]
});


{% endhighlight %}
