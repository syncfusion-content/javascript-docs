# Overview

The **MaskEdit** control provides an easy and reliable way of collecting user input and displaying standard data in a specific format. Some common uses of the **MaskEdit** control are IP address editors, phone number editors, and Social Security number editors.

**Key Features**

* **Mask**: The format in which the value should be entered in the text box can be set using this property.
* **Input Mode**: This feature allows the **MaskEdit** text box to act as an input text box or password text box.
* **Watermark Text**:The **MaskEdit** text box supports watermarking. A watermark is background text that appears in the text box without interfering with user text entry or the readability of the text entered. It can be used to display a ready instruction or other important information for the user. It appears automatically before the text is entered and disappears once the user begins entering text.
* **Theme**: **Essential JavaScript** **MaskEdit** controls feature 12 built-in themes: six flat themes and six with gradient effects. They also support custom skin options for user-defined themes.
