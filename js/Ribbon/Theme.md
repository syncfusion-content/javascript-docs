# Theme

**Ribbon** controlâ€™s style and appearance are controlled based on CSS classes. In order to apply styles to the Ribbon control, refer to two files namely, ej.widgets.core.min.css and ej.theme.min.css. When the file ej.widgets.all.min.css is referred, it is not necessary to include the files **ej.widgets.core.min.css** and **ej.theme.min.css** in your project as **ej.widgets.all.min.css** is the combination of these two files. 

By default, there are 12 theme supports available for Ribbon control namely,
