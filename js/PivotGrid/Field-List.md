# Field List

>_**Note:**Â This feature is applicable only for OLAP datasource._

Field List (also known as Pivot Schema Designer) is powerful tool that allows you to create and manage PivotTable (PivotGrid) with multi-dimensional/relational data. Using this **PivotGrid** you can visualize large amount of data in cross-tabular format and the Field List also allows you to filter members and also to customize the report dynamically on the fly using drag-and-drop operation.

{% highlight js %}

 $(function() {
     $("#PivotGrid").ejPivotGrid({
         url: "/wcf/PivotGridService.svc",
         afterServiceInvoke: "onServiceInvokes"
     });
 });

 function onServiceInvokes(args) {
     if (args.action == "initialize")
         $("#PivotSchemaDesigner").ejPivotSchemaDesigner({
             pivotControl: this,
             layout: ej.PivotSchemaDesigner.Layouts.Excel
         });
 }
{% endhighlight %}

###Filtering 

Filter pop-up window can be launched by clicking on the expander icon available at the right-hand corner of each field item. Values can be filtered by checking/unchecking the check box besides them in the filter pop-up window. As a result of the filtering operation, PivotGrid is refresh showing the updated values.

##Layout Section

The layout section is used to rearrange and reposition the fields in a **PivotGrid**. It has the following areas:

###Report Filter

Report filter is used to filter the entire report based on the selected item in the report filter. The Report filter pop-up window can be launched by clicking on the expander icon available in the right corner of each field item.

###Column Label

The column label is used to display fields as columns at the top of a report. A column lower in position is nested within another column immediately above it in the **PivotGrid**.

###Row Label

The row label is used to display fields as rows at the top of a report. A row lower in position is nested within another row immediately besides it in the PivotGrid.

###Value Label

The value label usually displays the selected numeric value filed of the pivot report and numeric value can be directly dragged into the value label.
