# Overview

The **DatePicker** control for **JavaScript** provides support for displaying a calendar within a webpage and allows users to pick a date. The **DatePicker** displays the dates of the current month with the current date highlighted. You can customize the date format, restrict the selectable date ranges, localize the culture to change the language of the **DatePicker** calendar, and drill down to month, decades, and centuries. A Today button option in the footer helps navigation and sets the current system day in the **DatePicker**.

**Key Features**

* **Previous and next button**: The **DatePicker** control contains the previous and next buttons to navigate to other months, decades, and centuries.
* **Min and Max date range**: These features allow the selectable date ranges to be restricted.
* **Dates in Other Months**: This feature allows the **DatePicker** to show dates in other months.
* **Start and depth level**: This feature allows the control to display the calendar to starting from days, months, years, or decades. It can also restrict the drill-down depth. 
* **Date Format and Localization**: The **DatePicker** control uses Globalize.js, a simple **JavaScript** library that allows users to globalize and localize the format and dates in a culture-specific fashion. This Globalize.js can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/jquery/globalize). 
* **Keyboard Navigation**: Users can interact with the **DatePicker** control by using the keyboard.
