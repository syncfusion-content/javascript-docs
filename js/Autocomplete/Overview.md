# Overview

The Autocomplete control for JavaScript is a textbox control that provides a list of suggestions based on the user query. When the user enters a text in the text box, the control performs the search operation and provides a list of results in the suggestion pop up. There are several filter types available to perform the search.

**Key Features**

* Multi word Search: Supports searching using multiple words. 

* Data binding: Supports data binding with JSON data and remote data.

* Template: The [template](https://help.syncfusion.com/api/js/ejautocomplete#members:template) property supports templates for customizing the suggestion list content.

* Highlight Search: The [highlightSearch](https://help.syncfusion.com/api/js/ejautocomplete#members:highlightsearch) property supports highlighting the typed text in the suggestion list.

* Auto Fill: The [enableAutoFill](https://help.syncfusion.com/api/js/ejautocomplete#members:enableautofill) property allows the control to automatically select the first suggested item.

* Keyboard Interaction: Supports using the keyboard to focus on the control, navigate through the suggestion results, and select a value.
