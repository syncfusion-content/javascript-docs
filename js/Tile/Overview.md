# Overview

The **Essential Studio** for **JavaScript Web Tiles** are simple, opaque rectangles or squares and they are arrayed on the start screen in a grid-like pattern. **Tapping** or **selecting** a **Tile**, launches the app or does some other action that is represented by the Tile. **Tiles** are arranged in a group separated by columns that looks like a start screen of a device and it can be either static or live.
