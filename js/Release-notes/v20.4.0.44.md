# Essential Studio for JavaScript  Release Notes  

{% include release-info.html date="January 18, 2023"  version="v20.4.0.44" %} 



## Common

### Breaking changes

It was announced in 2019 that the Syncfusion Essential JS 1 (jQuery-based widgets) are no longer actively developed and users are encouraged to switch to the next-generation, pure JavaScript-based Essential JS 2 library. Despite this, support and bug fixes were provided for the last four years. However, 2022 Volume 4 marked the last release of the Syncfusion JavaScript controls of Essential JS 1 (jQuery-based widgets). We recommend using the Syncfusion JavaScript controls of Essential JS 2, which has been specifically designed to be lightweight and modular. Its size can be further optimized by including only the necessary controls and features for your application. 
For more information, check out the Essential JS 2 library's [documentation](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/introduction/) and [demo](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/demos/#/bootstrap5/grid/grid-overview.html).
